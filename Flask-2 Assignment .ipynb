    "HTTP Protocol is necessary for data communication. In the context of the World Wide Web, an HTTP method is a request method that a client (e.g. a web browser) can use when making a request to a server (e.g. a web server). There are several HTTP methods that a client can use when making a request. In Flask, there are different methods to handle HTTP requests. e.g GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD. These methods are used to Send, Request, and Modify data on the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GET:**  This method is used to retrieve data from the server. e.g In an eCommerce application, there is a search button to search for an item. after entering a keyword if we noticed, the keyword you searched for gets displayed in the URL. This request is used when the data is not sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**POST:** This method makes enables users to send data over to the server. e.g In any authentication-enabled application, the registration and login form is the best example for the post method. Whenever we enter Information and submit the data get transferred over to the POST request. And if we noticed, unlike get request there is no information will be ever displayed in the URL."

Rather than passing the request object to each function that runs during a request, the request and session proxies are accessed instead.This is similar to The Application Context, which keeps track of the application-level data independent of a request. A corresponding application context is pushed when a request context is pushed.\n",

Flask uses the term context local for this.\n",

Unlike Python, blocks are denoted by start and end tags rather than indentation since static text within a block could change indentation."
