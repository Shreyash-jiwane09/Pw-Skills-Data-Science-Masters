    "Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in Python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with classes in Python, the term “self” refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. Whenever you call a method of an object created from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter. This enables you to modify the object’s properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance."
